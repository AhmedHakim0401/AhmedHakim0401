  Welcome to Ahmed Hakim's profile!
</h3>

I'm a Multidisciplinary Engineering Student at "Ecole Polytechnique de Tunisie", I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies to improve my skills. As someone who is passionate about Artificial Intelligence (AI), I am eager to use my skills to contribute to innovation in Tunisia, Africa, and beyond. My interest in AI grew from my studies in mathematics during my pre-engineering education, and I am excited to apply that knowledge to create tech-based solutions. In my free time, I enjoy participating in competitions on platforms like ZINDI and KAGGLE to enhance my skills.
